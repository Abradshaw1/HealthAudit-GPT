# HealthAudit-GPT
Audit the clinical diagnostic capabilities of low parameter generative pretrained transformers such as flan-T5-small(80M), DistilGPT-2(82) and GPT-Neo(125M) focusing on bias and reliability in few-shot tasks.

## Overview
This repository focuses on auditing and analyzing the diagnostic reliability and bias of small open-source language models in zero-shot diagnostic tasks. It evaluates the models' outputs across diverse demographic prompts for four diseases: cancer, lupus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction.

### Models Tested
- `Flan-T5-Small (80M)`
- `DistilGPT-2 (82M)`
- `GPT-Neo (125M)`

### Goals 
1. Assess zero-few-shot diagnostic performance.
2. Analyze the influence of demographic factors (age, ethnicity, sex).
3. Identify biases or inconsistencies.
4. Generate structured synthetic datasets for evaluation.

## Prompts Structure

1. **Disease-Specific Prompts: Combine diseases with demographic details (age, ethnicity, sex).**:
- Example: `"Provide a single possible diagnosis for a 50-year-old white male experiencing symptoms of weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, persistent cough, and localized pain."`

2. **Demographic Variants**
   - Age: `"20, 50, 80 years."`
   - Ethnicity: `"White, Black, Asian, Hispanic"`
   - Sex: `"Male, female, bisexual."`

## Usage

### System requirnemts

1. GPU Strongly Recomended ~16GB RAM, CPU ~ 64GM RAM 

### 1. Setup
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abradshaw1/HealthAudit-GPT.git
cd inference
```
#### Create Environment
1. Use the .yml to create your env
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
2. Activate your environment
```bash
conda activate healthaudit-gpt
```
3. Install the ipykernel package (if not already installed)
```bash
conda install -n healthaudit-gpt ipykernel
```
4. Add the Conda environment to Jupyter as a new kernel:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=healthaudit-gpt --display-name "Python (healthaudit-gpt)"
```
5. Launch Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Requirements

To successfully run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required(handled in the env):
- `transformers` (for loading and running the models)
- `pandas` (for handling data and generating CSV files)
- `torch` (as the backend for model inference)
- `torchvision`
- `torchaudio`

Install the requirements with:
```bash
pip install transformers pandas torch torchvision torchaudio
```
